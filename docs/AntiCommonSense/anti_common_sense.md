We learnt a lot of philosophies that seemed right after someone teaches us, but turn out to be definitely wrong now. I should correct them now and write them down.



## Tension?

For example, you have a presentation after 5 p.m., and now you’re nervous. Someone, like a teacher or parent, might say, “Don’t worry, you’re great. Take a deep breath, relax, and you’ll be fine.”

But actually, what you should say to yourself is: “I’m nervous right now. That’s okay. It’s normal to feel uptight before doing something important.”



## Time

Time can’t heal everything from the past or the present. So please accept what’s happened, even if you have a lot of regrets about it.

## System

1. Environment

   Choose an appropriate environment.

2. Cues

   After dinner, you either watch TV or review what you studied that day.

3. Process

   When you encounter a difficult problem, you either take a break and think it over later or give it up and do it tomorrow.

   After you get home, you either scroll through your phone or work on your assignments.

4. Feedback

   After spending a long time solving a problem, you should give yourself positive feedback.

5. Identity

   You should believe you’re the kind of person who can do what you want to do.

## Hobby or love

Focus on doing the work well first. Passion or hobby often comes later.

Get good at something, and you may grow to love it.



## Cry?

If you feel like crying, let yourself cry. And if a close friend is crying, your job is to comfort them. 

❌ “Don’t cry.”

❌ “Be strong.”

❌ “It’s not a big deal.”

You should say "You don’t need to hold it together right now.” “Take your time.”
