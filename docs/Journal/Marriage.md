For a marriage to thrive, I believe in there principles:

## Phase 1: Before Having Children (The Foundation)

- **Core Values & Living Together:** You must be on the same page regarding your fundamental beliefs. This prevents massive blowups when life-changing decisions arise. Move in together before tying the knot; you need to see their quirks—how they organize, where they hide things, and their cleaning habits.
- **The United Front (External):** Present a united front to the world. If your spouse is treated unfairly, stand by them no matter what. Never take an outsider’s side in public. Unless they have done something dead wrong, have their back first and discuss the details behind closed doors.Look, if you need to **save face** in front of your sisters, you can tell them you **hold the purse strings** at home. You can even **poke fun at me** in public to show off how much I adore you—but don’t you dare actually look down on me. If you start truly resenting me, I’m going to be very angry.
- **The Caretaker Philosophy:** Arguments can happen even during sex, but you must protect her. She is your wife, and if her health is fragile, you must be her caretaker. Do not get too rough or wild if it isn't right for her.
- **Equality & Reciprocity:** Real equality is about consent and a healthy give-and-take. It’s a fair exchange: "I’ll satisfy your needs today, and you can satisfy mine tomorrow." But if it’s my turn and you’re just not feeling it, that’s perfectly fine—I’ll wait until the time is right for you. It’s all about balance.

## Phase 2: If you have kids,please follow the rules. Of course,if you dont wanna have kids, It's ok

- **The Parenting Game Plan:** Decide who does the heavy lifting and how to split costs. Grandparents should not be primary caregivers; that responsibility lies with the parents. Since kids have endless energy, be ready to play—no mindless scrolling or binge-watching in front of them.

- **Emotional Safety:** Never fight with your partner in front of the children. Instead, make an effort to appropriately show affection in front of them so they grow up seeing a loving example.

- **Discipline & Tolerance:** Stay united on how to handle the kids. Whether you shut down a tantrum immediately or let them learn the hard way, you must hash this out beforehand so you don't undermine each other.

- **The Couple’s Sanctuary:** Don’t let physical intimacy slide. Talk about your sex life regularly—check in on what’s working and adjust as you go. Most importantly, schedule regular "couple time" to escape the noise and focus solely on each other.

- **The Golden Formula:** Always keep an eye on the math of your relationship:

  `Stability = Frequency of Sex - Frequency of Quarrels`

I truly hope everyone finds this kind of wonderful, balanced marriage.
