For a marriage to thrive, I believe in four things:

**First off,** you’ve got to be on the same page when it comes to your core values. It saves you from those massive blowups later when life throws big decisions at you. Also, **move in together** before tying the knot. You need to see their quirks—how they organize things, where they hide stuff, or even just their cleaning habits.

**Second,** if you're planning on having kids, you need a game plan. Who’s doing the heavy lifting? How are you splitting the costs? My rule is: grandparents shouldn't be the primary caregivers; it’s on the parents. And since kids have endless energy, you’ve got to be ready to play. That means **no mindless scrolling** or binge-watching in front of them unless it’s absolutely necessary.

**Third,** you and your partner need to be a united front on **discipline and tolerance.** If the kid is throwing a tantrum or acting out, do you shut it down immediately, or do you let them learn the hard way and then be there to pick up the pieces? You’ve got to hash this out beforehand.

**Forth,** don't let the physical intimacy slide. Even with kids, you need to talk about your **sex life**—check in regularly, see what’s working, and adjust as you go.

`Stability = Frequency of Sex - Frequency of Quarrels`

**Fifth, you’ve got to present a united front to the world.** If your spouse gets picked on or treated unfairly out there, you **stand by them** no matter what. You don't take the outsider's side in public. Unless they’ve done something **dead wrong**, you have their back first and talk about the details behind closed doors.

Maybe arguments can happen even **during sex**, so you must protect her—she’s your wife, and since her health is fragile, you have to be her caretaker and **not get too rough or wild**. Real equality is about consent and taking turns: **I’ll satisfy your sexual needs today**, and you can satisfy mine tomorrow. It’s all about a fair exchange.

I truly hope everyone finds that kind of wonderful marriage.
