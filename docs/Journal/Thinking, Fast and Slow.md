This's what I learn from this book.

## Anchoring Effect

When you go shopping, you see a piece of clothing with a price tag of $500. Then the salesperson tells you it’s 40% off. Instantly, you feel lucky, like you’ve found an amazing bargain.

But in reality, that piece of clothing might only be worth $50.

This happens because your brain gets influenced by the first number you see. Instead of judging the real value, you unconsciously compare everything to that original price. You think you’re making a rational decision, but actually, your intuition is being guided by the initial anchor.

Don’t rush. Compare prices with other stores or online.

## Loss Aversion

If you go to a movie and don’t like it, just leave as soon as you can.
 Don’t worry about the money you already spent. It doesn’t matter.

The same goes for plans and work.



## Regression to the Mean

Sometimes your kids do something wrong, and they already feel sad and regret it. But you still scold them. When they do better next time, you might think the scolding worked.

But actually, even if you encourage them instead of scolding, they would probably improve anyway — especially if they already felt bad about what they did.



When buying products, people usually pay more attention to the average value rather than the total amount.

Also, when an expensive product comes with a very small free gift, people may start to feel suspicious. They might think the product is fake or has some hidden defects.





## Narrative Fallacy

People like stories more than statistics.
In fact, stories can oftentimes be false or exaggerated.



## Peak-End Rule

People tend to remember the best moment and the ending of a trip.They usually forget the length of the trip or what happened along the way, especially if there was a really good or really bad moment and a memorable ending.

For work, it’s often better to pick somewhere closer so you don’t spend too much time commuting, if your budget allows.

For running, don’t quit when you feel the most tired. Try to finish strong.

The same goes for life. Maybe you dont like it when scrolling through your phone for a long time



## Planning Fallacy

Avoid locking in plans when you’re in a very good mood, because you’re more likely to think things will take less time than they actually do.

Instead, try to base your plan on the average time others spend doing similar work in your field.

## Halo Effect

When we see people in respectable professions, like teachers, lawyers, dancers, or psychologists, and so and son, we often assume they have good lifestyles and strong moral values.

But in reality, their personal lives — including their qualities or sexual lives — can be very different from what we imagine. They might be complicated, messy, or simply not as perfect as people expect.



## Law of Small Numbers

People often believe that something supported by statistics must be true. That’s a common assumption.

However, in effect, the sample size may be too small to draw a reliable conclusion. Statistics based on limited data can easily be misleading.



Another example is when a friend describes someone’s personality. You might immediately associate that personality with a stereotype, such as thinking the person is probably a programmer.

But statistically speaking, it may actually be more likely that the person is a salesperson, simply because there are far more salespeople than programmers. People often ignore the base rate and rely on stereotypes instead.



## Availability Heuristic

Sometimes you see news about a major plane crash, and it makes you feel too scared to fly. But the truth is, even a year later, the actual risk of flying is usually about the same.

You need to remember that news often reports rare and dramatic events. Don’t let those low-probability stories control your decisions.
