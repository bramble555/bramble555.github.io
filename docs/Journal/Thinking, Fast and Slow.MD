This's what I learn from this book.

## Anchoring Effect

When you go shopping, you see a piece of clothing with a price tag of $500. Then the salesperson tells you it’s 40% off. Instantly, you feel lucky, like you’ve found an amazing bargain.

But in reality, that piece of clothing might only be worth $50.

This happens because your brain gets influenced by the first number you see. Instead of judging the real value, you unconsciously compare everything to that original price. You think you’re making a rational decision, but actually, your intuition is being guided by the initial anchor.

Don’t rush. Compare prices with other stores or online.

## Loss Aversion

If you go to a movie and don’t like it, just leave as soon as you can.
 Don’t worry about the money you already spent. It doesn’t matter.

The same goes for plans and work.



## Regression to the Mean

Sometimes your kids do something wrong, and they already feel sad and regret it. But you still scold them. When they do better next time, you might think the scolding worked.

But actually, even if you encourage them instead of scolding, they would probably improve anyway — especially if they already felt bad about what they did.



When buying products, people usually pay more attention to the average value rather than the total amount.

Also, when an expensive product comes with a very small free gift, people may start to feel suspicious. They might think the product is fake or has some hidden defects.





## Narrative Fallacy

People like stories more than statistics.
In fact, stories can oftentimes be false or exaggerated.



## Peak-End Rule





## Planning Fallacy



## Halo Effect

When we see people in respectable professions, like teachers, lawyers, dancers, or psychologists, and so and son, we often assume they have good lifestyles and strong moral values.

But in reality, their personal lives — including their qualities or sexual lives — can be very different from what we imagine. They might be complicated, messy, or simply not as perfect as people expect.
