I’ve realized how important dopamine is. I want to make a big change and kick the bad habits I've had for 10 years or more.

I'm going to stop watching videos while eating and quit scrolling through my phone before bed.I will commit to screen-free meals and a phone-free bedtime routine.

I don't know how long I can keep this up, but I'm going to stick with it.
