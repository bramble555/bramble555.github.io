I’ve realized how important dopamine is. I want to make a big change and kick the bad habits I've had for 10 years or more.

I'm going to stop watching videos while eating and quit scrolling through my phone before bed. I will commit to screen-free meals and a phone-free bedtime routine.

I don't know how long I can keep this up, but I'm going to stick with it.

I cant follow the schedule,because I got caught up watching TV after dinner. Damn it!

I got up to pee in the middle of the night. And then I checked my phone, and then I couldt fall back asslep.

I need to kick the bad habit.

I totally hit it off with a classmate today! Out of nowhere, we found out we're both into funds. Even though we've known each other for five years, we barely talked. But man, she’s such a chatterbox and I’m loving it. I'm so hyped!
